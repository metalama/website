ðŸŽ‰ **Welcome to Metalama!**

We're absolutely thrilled to have you here.

Metalama opens the door to advanced and efficient meta-programming, excelling in code generation and validation. Think of it as a modern reinvention of aspect-oriented programming for .NET. Our motto: _If it's repetitive, it can be automated._ Say goodbye to tedious tasks and cumbersome boilerplate. Welcome to clean, maintainable, and DRY code.

Let's get you started on this exciting journey:

- ðŸŒŸ **[Using Metalama](https://doc.metalama.net/conceptual/using):** Start here if, like most developers, you will use Metalama but won't author your own aspects.
- ðŸš€ **[Building Aspects](https://doc.metalama.net/conceptual/getting-started):** Ready to build your own aspects? This is your launchpad.
- ðŸ›’ **[Metalama Marketplace](/marketplace):** Discover pre-built aspect libraries to save time and effort.
- ðŸ“š **[Use Cases](/applications):** Learn when Metalama is the right tool for the job (and when it isn't).

Happy coding!
