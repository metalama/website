            <p>
                Metalama follows an <i>open core</i> business model: most of its features (and not just the core ones) are free and open
                source, while convenience features and extension packages are offered under a commercial license.
                If you're using Metalama for serious work in a corporate environment, we recommend a <b>Metalama
                    Enterprise</b> subscription. It supports the long-term sustainability of the project and gives you access to all
                features and our highest level of support.
