{: .intro }
Metalama is an open-source project backed by PostSharp Technologies, the team that created PostSharp in 2004 and has maintained it ever since. That's 20 years of experience in supporting and maintaining development tools for .NET developers, serving tens of thousands of professionals.

Consider purchasing an enterprise subscription for the following benefits:

- **Support SLA: 1 or 2 business days.** Have a senior engineer address your support requests within 1 (E2) or 2 (E1) business days.
- **Full source code access.** Gain access to the source code of premium packages through a private GitHub repository, with the rights to edit and build.
- **Long-term support builds.** We will continue to maintain select YYYY.N versions for two years, provided the underlying .NET SDK or Visual Studio versions are still supported by Microsoft.
- **Security/GDPR/vendor forms.** We will complete various security, GDPR, and vendor forms. Available from E2.
- **Private Slack/Teams channel.** Access a private Slack or Teams channel for support and direct communication with our senior developers and architects.
- **Video calls.** Receive remote assistance through video calls directly from our senior developers and architects.
- **Skip-the-line bug fix releases.** If we resolve a bug for you, we'll release the fix immediately, bypassing the normal release cycle. Available from E2.
- **Advisory calls.** Enjoy direct access to Metalama's founder and developers for consulting or code reviews beyond the usual support scope.
- **Recognition as an open-source sponsor.** Enterprise customers can choose to be publicly recognized as sponsors of our open-source projects.
- **EULA amendments.** Includes amendments to the End User License Agreement. Available from E3.
- **Regression shield.** Integrate your own test suite into our CI/CD pipeline to catch regressions before they are released. Available from E3.
