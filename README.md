## Installing Jekyll on Windows

1. Install Ruby 3.2:

   ```
   winget install RubyInstallerTeam.RubyWithDevKit.3.2
   ```

   > It will NOT work with Ruby 3.1!

2. Restart the terminal so that `PATH` is reloaded.

3. In the Ruby prompt, do: 

   ```
   gem install jekyll bundler
   ```
   then:
   ```
   bundle install
   ```

## Running locally

On a command prompt, execute:

```
run-all.ps1
```

## Writing posts

### Drafts

Drafts that are _queued_ (not for immediate publication) must be created under the `_drafts` folder.

### Frontmatter


Here is an example:


```yml
layout: post
origin: postsharp
comments: false

#### Required

* `layout`: Must be `new-post`.
* `categories`: Use only existing categories!
* `date`: Must be a past date.
* `permalink`: The path where the article is published.

#### SEO

* `title`: This is both the HTML title and the readable title.
* `keywords`
* `summary`

#### Images

* `image`: The image shown in the post page. Must have a dark purple background.
* `thumbnail`: Optional. The image shown in the home page or category page. Can have a different background.

### Source code

* `source_url`: typically the GitHub URL. When an article is published (not draft), the master branch must be used. When editing, you can use a local path by using the `file://` prefix, e.g. `file://c:/src...`


## Remote code snippets

We use a fork of `jekyll_include_plugin` to render snippets hosted on GitHub.

The typical use is the following:

```
{% include_file "{{page.source_url}}/Sample1/Program.cs" syntax="csharp" snippet="AddMemoryCache" %}
```

Notes:
* Always use `{{page.source_url}}` to refer to the source repo. The plug-in will transform the URL to point to the raw file.
* `syntax` is required
* `snippet` is optional and refers to a mark-up in the remote file. Here is an example:
    
    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
    
    namespace Sample1.Pages;
    
    public class BaseModel : PageModel
    {
        // [<snippet currencies>]
        public IReadOnlyList<string> Currencies { get; } =
        [
            "bitcoin",
            "ethereum",
            "euro",
            "british-pound-sterling"
        ];
        // [<endsnippet currencies>]
    }
    
    ```

* `indent` is an optional attribute, set to an integer, which indents the snippet by the given number of spaces. This number must be equal than the indentation of the {% include_file %} snippet itself. This is useful to include snippets in lists. For instance:

    ```
    Some list:

        * Item 1
        * Item 2

            {% include_file "{{page.source_url}}/Sample1/Program.cs" syntax="csharp" indent="4" %}

    ```    


## Requirements for snippets

* Use remote snippets (not inline snippets) whenever possible.
* The code must compile without warning.
* The code must be nicely formatted with text width of 120 characters.
