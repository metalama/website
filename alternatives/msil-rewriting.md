summary: "MSIL Rewriting modifies binary assemblies post-C# compilation. Tools like PostSharp, Mono.Cecil, Fody, AspectInjector, and Rougamo use this approach."

{: .intro }
_MSIL Rewriting_ is the process of modifying the binary assembly during the build process. An additional rewriting step is added to this process just after the C# compiler. These tools can add MSIL instructions, as well as new types and members, during the build.

The following tools are based on MSIL rewriting:

* [PostSharp](https://www.postsharp.net/il) implements its own MSIL rewriting stack.
* [Mono.Cecil](https://github.com/jbevain/cecil) is a standalone library that can be used to modify .NET assemblies.
* [Fody](fody) is based on `Mono.Cecil`. It integrates with MSBuild and implements a plug-in system so that MSIL transformations can be easily packaged and combined.
* [AspectInjector](https://github.com/pamidur/aspect-injector) and [Rougamo](https://github.com/inversionhourglass/Rougamo) are AOP frameworks based on `Mono.Cecil`.
