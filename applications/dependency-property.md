{: .intro }
Dependency properties enable advanced property behaviors such as data binding, animation, and styling. However, implementing dependency properties in WPF often requires writing repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code, which can slow down development and introduce bugs. 

{: .intro }
`Metalama.Patterns.Wpf` addresses this issue by allowing developers to generate dependency properties directly from C# automatic properties. This eliminates the need for boilerplate code, boosts productivity, and ensures cleaner, more maintainable code.

{: .note }
`Metalama.Patterns.Wpf` is a production-ready, professionally-supported and open-source aspect library. <i class="supported no-tooltip"></i>

{: .note }
Available for WPF only.
