Security is a critical aspect of modern software development. Metalama provides powerful tools to enhance security by enabling developers to add cross-cutting concerns like authorization, auditing, and encryption into their applications without writing boilerplate code.

## Authorization

Metalama can be used to implement authorization by weaving aspects into your code to enforce role-based or permission-based access control. For example, you can create an aspect that checks the user's roles or permissions before allowing access to specific methods or classes.

## Audit

With Metalama, you can implement auditing by creating an aspect that logs method calls, parameter values, and execution results. This aspect can be applied to critical methods to ensure that all actions are recorded for compliance and debugging purposes.

## Transparent homomorphic encryption

Metalama can assist in implementing transparent homomorphic encryption by weaving aspects that automatically encrypt and decrypt data at specific points in your code. This ensures that sensitive data remains encrypted during processing without requiring manual encryption logic in your business code.
