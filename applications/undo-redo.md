Undo/redo is a consistently popular feature, especially in UIs that do not rely on an _Ok_ button. A common way to implement it is by following the Memento pattern, originally formalized in the renowned "Gang of Four's" Design Patterns book.

For details, see the [Memento Pattern](design-patterns#memento) on this website.
