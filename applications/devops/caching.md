{: .intro }
Caching is probably the simplest way to boost the performance of an application. Maintaining a cache can be cumbersome,
especially if you must add caching to dozens of methods and manage dependencies. Metalama makes this process simpler and
more robust.

Traditionally, setting up caching involves working directly with the caching framework's API. You need to create cache
keys, check if items are already in the cache, and add new items when necessary. Additionally, when the original data
changes, you must ensure the cache is updated accordingly. It is one of the most error-prone tasks in software
development.

With [Metalama Caching](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Metalama.Patterns.Caching), an open-source caching library based
on Metalama, adding caching to a method can be as simple as adding a custom attribute.

`Metalama.Patterns.Caching` is a production-ready, professionally-supported and open-source aspect library. <i class="supported no-tooltip"></i>

## Benefits

* **Reduced boilerplate**: Metalama Caching enables you to cache the return value of a method as a function of its
  arguments with just a `[Cache]` custom attribute. To invalidate the cache, add the `[InvalidateCache]` aspect to the
  update methods. To use a custom class as a parameter of a cached method, apply the `[CacheKey]` aspect to mark the
  properties that uniquely identify the object. Consequently, your business code becomes shorter and more readable.

* **Reduced bugs**: Manually generating cache keys with hand-written code is notoriously bug-prone. Metalama Caching
  eliminates this source of defects by implementing a reliable approach to key generation, combining object-oriented and
  aspect-oriented techniques.

* **Reduced coupling**: Cache invalidation can be complex and often requires you to review your complete write methods
  every time you add caching to a read method. Cache dependencies act as an abstraction layer between read and write
  methods, reducing coupling between them.

## Features

* `[Cache]` aspect for caching.
* `[InvalidateCache]` aspect for cache invalidation.
* `[CacheKey]` aspect to generate cache keys from objects.
* Type-safe cache invalidation API.
* Full support for dependency injection.
* Support for dependencies.
* Support for Redis.
* Support for cache synchronization over a message bus.
* Open source.

## Example

Here is how caching can look using Metalama:

```cs
internal partial class CustomerServices
{
    [Cache]
    public Customer GetCustomer(int id)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($">> Retrieving the customer {id} from database...");
        Thread.Sleep(1000);
        return new Customer { Id = id, Name = "Rubber Debugging Duck" };
    }

    [InvalidateCache(nameof(GetCustomer))]
    public void UpdateCustomer(int id, string newName)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($">> Updating the customer {id} in database...");
        Thread.Sleep(1000);
    }
}
```

To initialize Metalama Cache, add this line to your startup code:

```csharp
// Add the caching service.
builder.Services.AddMetalamaCaching();
```
