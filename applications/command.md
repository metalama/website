One of the [best practices](https://metalama.net/blog/wpf-best-practices-2024) in WPF is to implement the logic behind
buttons and menu items as a Command (`ICommand`) instead of a simple event handler. This keeps the command logic
separate from the UI code, achieving a better separation of concerns. It also allows the button or menu item to render
itself as grayed out when the command is not available, thanks to `CanExecute`.

The implementation of WPF commands requires some redundant code, especially to integrate the `CanExecute` logic.

The [Command](https://doc.metalama.net/patterns/wpf/command) aspect of the `Metalama.Patterns.Wpf` open-source
package solves this problem by automatically generating the plumbing code. It integrates with
the [Observable](https://doc.metalama.net/patterns/observability) aspect to provide support for the
`CanExecute` logic.

Available for WPF only


## Example

In the following example, the `[Command]` aspect will generate an `ExecuteSaveCommand` property based on the
`ExecuteSave` method and the `CanExecuteSave` property.

```csharp
[Observable]
public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
    public bool HasChanges { get; private set; };

    [Command]
    public void ExecuteSave()
    {
        // Details skipped.
    }

    public bool CanExecuteSave => this.HasChanges;
}
```

## Benefits

* **Boost your productivity**. Minimize boilerplate code to implement ICommand properties.
* **Keep your code clean and concise**. Your business logic is easier to read and less entangled.

## Features

* Idiomatically C#: Metalama works _with_ your code, not against it.
* Supports simple, parameterized, async, and background commands.
* Integrates with the `[Observable]` aspect to handle the `CanExecute` functionality without boilerplate.
* Open source (MIT).
