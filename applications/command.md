{: .intro }
One of the [best practices](https://metalama.net/blog/wpf-best-practices-2024) in WPF is to implement the logic behind buttons and menu items as a Command (`ICommand`) instead of a simple event handler. However, WPF commands require some redundant code, especially to integrate the `CanExecute` logic.

{: .intro }
The [Command](https://doc.metalama.net/patterns/wpf/command) aspect of the `Metalama.Patterns.Wpf` open-source package solves this problem by automatically generating the plumbing code.

{: .note }
`Metalama.Patterns.Wpf` is a production-ready, professionally-supported, and open-source aspect library. <i class="supported no-tooltip"></i>

{: .note }
Available for WPF only.

## Benefits

* **Boost your productivity**. Minimize boilerplate code to implement ICommand properties.
* **Keep your code clean and concise**. Your business logic is easier to read and less entangled.
* **Reduce human errors**. Eliminate repetitive code that is prone to mistakes.
* **Improve maintainability**. Keep your codebase clean and easier to understand.
* **Seamless integration**. Works with existing WPF projects without requiring major refactoring.

## Features

* Idiomatically C#: Metalama works _with_ your code, not against it.
* Supports simple, parameterized, async, and background commands.
* Integrates with the `[Observable]` aspect to handle the `CanExecute` functionality without boilerplate.

## Example

In the following example, the `[Command]` aspect will generate an `ExecuteSaveCommand` property based on the `ExecuteSave` method and the `CanExecuteSave` property.

```csharp
[Observable]
public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
    public bool HasChanges { get; private set; };

    [Command]
    public void ExecuteSave()
    {
        // Details skipped.
    }

    public bool CanExecuteSave => this.HasChanges;
}
```
