      As we are closing our Slack workspace, we will publish briefs (typically announcing builds) on this website instead. We'll keep
      briefs separate from long-form articles published on our blog. You can subscribe to briefs using RSS or JSON Feed from 
      [this page](https://metalama.net/briefs).
