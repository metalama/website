## Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and maintainers, commit to upholding high standards of professionalism, integrity, and responsibility. We aim to foster a respectful, focused environment where contributions are judged by merit, not identity or ideology. Our shared goal is to build and sustain technically excellent, practical software for the benefit of users and contributors alike.

## Objectives

- Develop reliable, well-engineered software tools through collaborative effort.
- Support users with tools that are practical, well-documented, and dependable.
- Enable contributors to pursue professional, technical, financial, or personal goals—on their own terms.
- Maintain a productive, rewarding, and enjoyable collaboration environment.
- Ensure long-term economic sustainability of the products.
- Advance technical knowledge through open, principled contribution.

## Decision-Making 

This community operates as a meritocracy. Authority is earned through meaningful, sustained contributions—technical, organizational, or financial. High-impact contributors have greater decision-making influence. Financial backers who support the project’s sustainability are granted proportional influence, reflecting their commitment to the project’s future.

Project leaders make final decisions based on technical merit, project goals, and long-term viability. Consensus is preferred but not mandatory. Disagreements must remain professional.
