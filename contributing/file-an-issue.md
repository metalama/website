## Crafting a good bug report

To increase your chances of resolving your issue quickly, please consider including the following in your report:

* The version of the Metalama packages and Visual Studio Tools for Metalama you are using.
* The version of the .NET SDK and IDE you are using.
* The operating system you are using.
* If this is a code issue:
    - The full error message, including the full exception stack.
    - If the error message refers to a file, the content of this file.
    - If possible, a standalone project reproducing the issue.
    - If relevant, you may be asked for:
        - A binary build log (`msbuild.binlog`) produced by `dotnet build /bl`.
        - A log file produced by following [these instructions](https://doc.metalama.net/conceptual/configuration/creating-logs).
        - Exceptionally, a [crash report](https://doc.metalama.net/conceptual/configuration/process-dump) or a [profiling snapshot](https://doc.metalama.net/conceptual/configuration/profiling).
* If this is a UI issue:
    - The steps to reproduce the issue. What steps can a person who reads your bug report perform to get the same results? How do these results differ from your expectations?
    - Screenshots.

{: .warning }
Binary build logs (`msbuild.binlog`), other log files, and crash reports contain data that might identify you or your company, and may leak fragments of source code.
