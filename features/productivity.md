{: .intro }
Metalama is a comprehensive product developed by the same team that maintained PostSharp for over 15 years. It encompasses all the productivity features you'd expect from a professional product.

| Feature | Description |
|----------|----------|
| [Ready-to-Use Aspect Libraries](aspect-libraries) | No need to reinvent the wheel. Metalama provides numerous professionally built and tested aspects that you can pull from NuGet and start using immediately. |
| [Visual Studio Tooling](tooling) <i class="premium"></i> | See how your code is affected by aspects directly in Visual Studio with Code Lens integration, Aspect Diff, and Aspect Explorer. Enjoy syntax highlighting for T#, Metalama's C#-to-C# template language. |
| [Test Frameworks](testing) | Test code generation patterns and the reporting of warnings and errors. |
| [Transformed Code Debugging](/features/debugging) | Choose whether to step into the transformed code or stick to the source code during debugging. You can see exactly which code is executed. |
