summary: "New this winter: Metalama and PostSharp 2025.0 Released, Metalama Goes Open-Source!"
---

As we returned from the winter break, we hit the ground running by launching **Metalama and PostSharp 2025.0**. But that wasn’t all—after careful consideration and experimentation, we’re thrilled to share some groundbreaking news: **Metalama is going open-source**!  

## Metalama and PostSharp 2025.0 are generally available

Following the release of Metalama and PostSharp 2025.0 Release Candidate (RC) in November, we dedicated much of December to squashing bugs. With Metalama maturing steadily, we’ve started addressing long-term, low-priority issues from our backlog.  

Our first major milestone of the year was deploying **PostSharp and Metalama 2025.0** on January 4th. Here’s what’s new:  

- **Metalama 2025.0**:  
  - Adds support for **C# 13** and **.NET 9**.  
  - Introduces significant enhancements to the aspect framework.  
  - Delivers substantial performance improvements.  
  Check out the [Metalama 2025.0 announcement](/blog/metalama-2025-0-ga).  

- **PostSharp 2025.0**:  
  - Adds support for **C# 13**, **.NET 9**, and long paths in projects targeting **.NET Framework**.  
  - Improves runtime performance for `WeakEventHandler`.  
  - Enhances the debugging experience with **Windows PDB files**.  
  Learn more in the [PostSharp 2025.0 announcement](/blog/postsharp-2025-0-ga).  

## **Metalama 2025.1: going open-source**  

Earlier this week, we announced that [Metalama 2025.1 will be free and open-source](/blog/metalama-open-source-plans). To ensure the project’s sustainability, we’ll offer commercial IDE tooling, extensions, and support. We fully commit to a cooperative development process, moving everything to GitHub. Metalama will get a dedicated website and GitHub organization, marking its evolution into an independent, community-driven project separate from PostSharp Technologies.  

Visit the [announcement](/blog/metalama-open-source-plans) to learn more about:  
- What will be free and open-source, and what won’t?  
- Our new commercial offerings.  
- Our updated policies for long-term support.  

Your input is invaluable as we implement these changes, so don’t hesitate to share your thoughts while the plans are still being developed.  

## **Godot + Metalama = ♡, by Philip Rotter**

Godot, the incredibly efficient open-source game engine, has gained popularity among developers. While many prefer using C# over GDScript due to its rich ecosystem, exporting C# properties to Godot often involves tedious boilerplate code.  

In his latest guest post, [Enhancing Godot Development with Metalama](/blog/metalama-with-godot), [Philip Rotter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-rotter-588a53259/) demonstrates how Metalama can streamline this process. By leveraging Metalama, Philip eliminates redundant code and makes C# development with Godot both fun and efficient — all through a simple, straightforward aspect.  

Thank you very much to Philip for this insightful contribution! It will be an invaluable resource for Godot users looking to explore Metalama for the first time.  

## **Looking ahead**  

With Metalama’s transition to open-source, 2025 is shaping to be an exciting year! We’re committed to empowering developers with cutting-edge tools to remove code repetition, built together in a collaborative community. Stay tuned for more updates, and don’t forget to share your feedback on [Slack](https://www.postsharp.net/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/metalama/discussions/388) as we continue to evolve and innovate. 

Happy meta-programming!
