We are thrilled to announce that we will be hosting weekly office hours every Thursday at the same time, between 5 and 6 PM, Central Europe time. To encourage interactions, we will conduct these events via a Zoom meeting.


The motto of this meeting: Ask Me Anything!

Every month, we will have a special meeting starting where the Metalama team will provide a status update, highlight new features, or provide some insights under the hood. Occasionally, external guests will join this session and showcase their work.


Please [book your seat](https://calendly.com/gaelf/metalama-office-hours) one day in advance and get the invite by email. The meeting is held only when there is at least one external participant.
